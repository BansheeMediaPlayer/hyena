This is a library of useful GUI and non-GUI C# code, originally used in Banshee.

It is not API stable, and so is not installed to the GAC.  Applications using
it should make a local copy of whatever pieces you use.  There are variables 
defined in the pkg-config files that contain assemblies and files needed for 
a given component of Hyena (eg hyena, hyena.data.sqlite, and hyena.gui).

pkg-config --variable=Assemblies hyena
pkg-config --variable=Files hyena

You can look at PDF Mod's configure.ac and Makefile.am for an example of how
to copy the assemblies/files:
